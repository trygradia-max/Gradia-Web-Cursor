## Review — Section 1: Hero (e168720) — 2026-08-29

**VERDICT: APPROVED — no blocking changes. Proceed to Section 2 (Problem) after reading the notes below.**

Verified: D-033 headline + support copy verbatim · chip eyebrow · ink pill + underlined
secondary per reference-trygtm · trust line correct · graphite frame labeled "Sample data"
with the canonical record (Sarah Mitchell · 2024 BMW X5 · $485) · approve-step highlighted
in accent — the control differentiator is visible in the hero itself, which is exactly right ·
metadata override so waitlist-era title/description never rides on this page — good catch ·
every string passes WHAT_GRADIA_DOES §4. The foundation-fixes commit (f28f6d0) was audited:
all seven fixes are legitimate Pass-1 bugs (the Tailwind `text-[var()]` length/color
ambiguity was real and would have poisoned every size utility) — good work.

Carry-forward notes (address in later sections, not as rework now):

- [ ] **N1 (founder decision, before cutover):** `Start your trial` points at `/#trial`,
  which doesn't exist — there is no signup flow yet. Decide the CTA destination at cutover:
  platform-app signup route, or waitlist capture until trial build (D-035/E01) ships.
  Until decided, the dead anchor is acceptable on the branch only.
- [ ] **N2:** `See how it works` targets `#how` — Section 3 (Connected flow) must carry
  `id="how"` when built.
- [ ] **N3:** Extract the sample record (Sarah Mitchell / 2024 BMW X5 / Full Detail +
  Ceramic Maintenance / $485) into `components/site/sample.ts` and import it in every
  section that shows product UI (3, 4, 5, 6). The continuity of ONE record across the page
  is the moat being demonstrated — it must be impossible for sections to drift.
- [ ] **N4 (founder, tooling):** Reviewer cannot see Vercel branch previews — Deployment
  Protection redirects to Vercel login. Either review previews yourself each round, or
  disable protection for preview deployments on `gradia-web-cursor` so the reviewer can
  screenshot them.

## Next up

Section 2 — Problem ("Running a shop shouldn't take six disconnected systems."), per
NEXT_TASK.md scope 2. Do N3 (sample.ts) as part of it. Same rhythm: build, screenshot at
375/768/1440, review your screenshots, push, stop.
